  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <h2></h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
  

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>As Digital Dodgeball is a game based on the Python programming language, you are going to need a working version of Python 3.</p>

<ul>
<li>For Windows or Mac users, the easiest method is likely installing the Anaconda Distribution, which can be found <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">here</a>. This will get you all the needed packages and modules as well as the Spyder IDE.</li>
<li>For Linux users, you should just be able to install Python 3 through your distribution&rsquo;s package manager. As they may be packaged separately, you&rsquo;ll also want Numpy and Matplotlib.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-the-game-files">Getting the Game Files</h2>

<p>Once you have Python on your system, you need to grab the game files. You can grab these either directly from my GitHub page or as a zip file.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you are GitHub savy, you can just open a command line and run</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/jrembold/WUPhys-CodeComp.git
</code></pre>

<p>which will create a game directory in whatever folder you were in.</p></li>

<li><p>If you are not yet on the GitHub fan-train, you can grab the identical files in the form of a zip file, which you can then unzip wherever you might like. You can grab the files <a href="https://github.com/jrembold/WUPhys-CodeComp/archive/release.zip">here</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing-a-basic-bot">Writing a basic bot</h2>

<p>With the files on your system, you are all set to start constructing your first bot! First understand that a &ldquo;game&rdquo; of Digital Dodgeball involves two separate programs running: the individual code for your bot and the server code that actually runs the game. As such, you will <em>never run your bot&rsquo;s code directly</em>! You will always write or edit the bot code, same it, and then run the separate server script to actually run the game. This is counter to most programs where you write and run them directly, so don&rsquo;t get this confused!</p>

<p>To walk you through the basics of bot creation, I&rsquo;ll step you through the basics of <code>RandomMan.py</code>. There are 5 example bots included in the Bots folder which are heavily commented to describe what is happening. Check those out if you have questions or are curious about different ways of implementing the code. For now, open up a text editor (or Spyder) and follow along with the creation of <code>RandomMan.py</code>!</p>

<p><code>RandomMan.py</code> starts with 3 lines that you always <em>must</em> have in order for your bot to run properly:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append('./')
import library as lib
</code></pre>

<p>The first two lines import the <code>sys</code> module for the sole purpose of running the second line. This is necessary so that we can keep the bots in a separate folder from the main directory. The 3rd line imports the core library files that your bot needs to understand to know how to talk to the game server and process moves.</p>

<p>In addition, we are creating a bot that will move randomly here, so we&rsquo;ll go ahead and import the <code>random</code> module as well</p>

<pre><code>import random
</code></pre>

<p>Here you could import any other common module that you think would help you write your script. Numpy is a common module I&rsquo;ll frequently load for other bots. As long as it is decently common, my server shouldn&rsquo;t have an issue running it when you submit the code to me.</p>

<p>The next line is to initialize the bot. This activates all the various class functions that you&rsquo;ll want to use and registers the bot with the server to let it know about the new player! This will always take the form:</p>

<pre><code>bot = lib.CBot(__file__)
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the naming conventions you could change if you wanted and understand what you are doing, but the <code>CBot(__file__)</code> portion should stay unchanged. <code>CBot</code> is the needed class from the <code>library</code> module and <code>__file__</code> tells the server that your bot&rsquo;s name is the same as whatever you called the filename. Otherwise, the server won&rsquo;t know what script to associate with your wins!</p>

<p>Now that the server knows of your existence, you should pause to get the latest information from the server. To do this, you can use the:</p>

<pre><code>bot.getMapState()
</code></pre>

<p>command. This will cause your bot code to wait until it hears back from the server about how the game is progressing. You&rsquo;ll want to run it each turn. Then, as long as the server hasn&rsquo;t told us we are dead (which can&rsquo;t happen the first turn!), we want to issue commands to our bot! For <code>RandomMan.py</code>, he just chooses 1 of the 5 possible moves randomly each turn. Put together, this will look like</p>

<pre><code>while bot.active:
    move = random.choice(['forward', 'rotCW', 'rotCCW', 'ball', 'ping'])
    bot.sendMessage( move )
    bot.getMapState()
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;ll break this down row by row. The first just ensures that your bot is still almong the living before sending a message back to the server. The server doesn&rsquo;t take kindly to dead bots trying to play the game. Then we choose what move we&rsquo;d like to make. Digital Dodgeball has 5 moves available at the moment, and each turn you can submit 1 move to the server. Here, we just randomly choose one from almong the 5. Then we send that move along to the server with <code>bot.sendMessage</code>. Finally, we go ahead and pause to get the map state again. This will let us know the results of all the moves that other bots sent in that turn and give us information to make our next move choice.</p>

<p>And that is it! All together, it looks something like:</p>

<pre><code># -- Imports --
import sys              #importing sys for the below command
sys.path.append('./')   #this lets us keep the bots in a separate directory
import library as lib   #importing the main library functions
import random           #This bot needs the random library

# -- Initialize Bot --
bot = lib.CBot(__file__)  #this initializes our bot and lets the server know what script ran it (the __file__ part)

# -- Get the first map state --
bot.getMapState()

# -- Main Code --
while bot.active:           #for as long as the bot is alive, do the following
    # Now we choose randomly from a list of our available moves
    move = random.choice(['forward', 'rotCW', 'rotCCW', 'ball', 'ping'])

    # And then we send the move to server
    bot.sendMessage( move )

    # Then get the map state once more
    bot.getMapState()
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve included a <code>BotTemplate.py</code> file in the main directory that you can use for a starting point for creating new bots.</p>

<h2 id="running-the-server">Running the Server</h2>

<p>At the moment the server can only be run from a command prompt. If you are comfortable with a command prompt, you just need to open a terminal and then navigate your way to the game directory using <code>cd</code>. In windows, you can simplify your life being holding <code>Control</code> and then right-clicking in the game directory. In the menu that pops up, one of the options should be something like &ldquo;Open command prompt here&rdquo;. Clicking this will open a terminal already navigated to the correct folder. There may be a similar command with Mac&rsquo;s, but I don&rsquo;t know it so someone feel free to enlighten me!</p>

<p>The server is another python script, so you can run it via</p>

<pre><code>python server.py -i &quot;RandomMan.py&quot; &quot;RandomMan.py&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-i</code> flag always precedes a list of which bots you want to compete. You can think of it as standing for which bots are <strong>I</strong>n the game. Here we are just running two copies of <code>RandomMan.py</code> against one another. You can add as many different or duplicate bots as you like, though if the map is too small the server won&rsquo;t be able to place them all far enough from each other at the start. After the match concludes, a matplotlib window should pop up which shows you a graphical depiction of what happened in the game. There are some other option parameters you can pass to the server, which are detailed in the Documentation link to the left.</p>

<p>Those are the basics! If you get hung up on anything, be sure to check out the documentation, or come talk to me in Collins 311!</p>
